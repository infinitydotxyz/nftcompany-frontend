## Introduction

This storybook contains documentation of components used in this project. All components rely on state machines so that
all component logic here remains future-proof. React componenets are merely wrappers around these state machines to map
user events to those of state machines. So if you are curious about any implementations, you'll be better off looking
inside the `systems` folder. Every state machine in this project is implemented in [Xstate](https://xstate.js.org/) and
there's a common component format for each `system`. And every `system` (or a logical unit) can be visualized by first
converting the `states.yaml` file for that component to a JSON file and then using
[Xstate Visualizer](https://xstate.js.org/viz/).
